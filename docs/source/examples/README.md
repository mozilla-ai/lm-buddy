## Working with LM Buddy

Submitting an LM Buddy job includes two parts: 
a YAML file that specifies configuration for your finetuning or evaluation job, 
and a driver script that either invokes the LM Buddy CLI directly 
or submits a job to Ray that invokes LM Buddy as its entrypoint.

## Examples

See the `examples/configs` folder for examples of the configuration structure. 
For a full end-to-end interactive workflow for using the package, see the example notebooks.
