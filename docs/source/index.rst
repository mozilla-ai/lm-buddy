====================================
LM Buddy is a collection of jobs for finetuning and evaluating open-source (large) language models.
The library makes use of YAML-based configuration files as inputs to CLI commands for each job,
and tracks job inputs/outputs with [Weights & Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/) artifacts.
